### Mash filter plates gap detection
Simple project in which I perform basic computer vision operations to detect and measure gaps between mash filter plates.
This is an important problem in the proper operation of the filter.

### Project stages
1. Import file
2. Select ROI
3. Convert to grayscale
4. Add Gaussian blur
5. Thresholding
6. Find contours
7. Draw rectangles and put text on the orginal image
